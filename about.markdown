Allyn Roberts started in cybersecurity as a SOC Analyst in 2015 at Intermountain Health. In 2016, after graduating with a Bachelor's degree in MIS, he received a full-time position at Intermountain on the Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery team. After a large cybersecurity reorganization at the end of 2021, Allyn changed positions to work on a newly created team: the Office of the CISO. 

Allyn's years in cybersecurity at Intermountain have helped lay a strong foundation on cybersecurity, though did not often provide opportunities on the technical side. This site was created to showcase Allyn's more technical work outside of his current job.
